# Advent of Code, 2023

I discovered this from [Daniel Persson's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DanielPersson)
a bit late in the season (31 Dec 2023) but still thought it would be fun to do, even if my vacation
is already almost over! üôÅ Good thing, however, is that since Advent is over, I can post my answers
without worrying about spoilers. So, if you want to do this on your own, no peeking unless you get
stuck. Heck, I've only done one so far, so no telling how often _I'll_ get stuck.

Anyway, go to the [2023 Advent of Code web site](https://adventofcode.com/2023) to join in on the fun!

I chose Python. I'm solving each in problem in a separate file,
using a utility class to handle input and output in a standard way
to somewhat remove all that code from each solution. Assuming there will
be input and the output can be printed to a file, I have:

- `aoc/{DD}.py` - The solution for the day. I'll put the problem as a comment at the top of each file.
- `aoc/{DD)-input.txt` - The input (if needed.. might change the extension as necessary).
- `aoc/{DD}-results.txt` - The result, which is concatenated in the resulting HTML file on GitHub pages.
- `aoc/utils.py` - The utilities to handle all the IO.
- `build.sh` - Used with the GitHub actions to automate things on GitHub.

I haven't looked ahead, so I don't yet know if this is a good organization; we'll see.

Merry Christmas, 2023, and Happy New Year, 2024!
