<article class="day"><h1>Day 01</h1>
<p>The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text;
each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover.
On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit
(in that order) to form a single two-digit number.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77.
Adding these together produces 142.</p>
<p>Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>Seems pretty simple, so I want to do this the most generic way possible without
using modules. It's the kind of thing I'd love to do in C if I actually remembered
the language. Walking across each string, getting each character, saving the first
and last and totalling them up at the end. Save memory by tallying them up as we
go, and heck, only three reusable variables are needed, well.. and the flag to
test when the first was found.</p>
<h2><code>--- Part Two ---</code></h2>
<p>Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out
with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".</p>
<p>Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76.
Adding these together produces 281.</p>
<p>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</p>
<h2>My thoughts on Part Two</h2>
<p>Okay, I didn't know there was a part two until solving part one.</p>
<p>For part two, I could use <code>"".replace()</code> to substitute digits first and
subsequently leave the rest of the logic the same.</p>
<p>But, I think I'll try to do it in one pass first, changing the for loop
to a while string-is-not-empty and a getchar function to inch forward
char-by-char to see if it matches a digit, keeping the rest of the logic
the same. Note that Python doesn't mutate strings, so I'll use the
convention of a cursor, called 'pos' (to note the position in the string).</p>
<p>I'll also break it up into functions so that we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>run either part 1 or part two</li>
<li>preserve the first, last, total logic for either</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, let's tweak that a bit because I read in a comment that <code>sevenine</code> would
be considered 79 rather than 77. So, I'll do this differently. Instead of
going from left to right all the way through, since we need only the first
and last, I'll go from the left to get the first, then stop and go in from the right
to get the last. That should do the trick. When coming in from the right, I'll spell
the numbers in reverse.</p><div class="my-solution"><h2>Day 01 solution</h2>
